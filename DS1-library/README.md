This project is designed to run exclusively in a Linux terminal due to the way it depends on the terminal environment to operate. It features a menu that can be navigated using the arrow keys, and it allows the use of key bindings.

You can check out a demo of how it works [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zdUvP5eX-bBRRQ-hYIN5FaIp_f_S-DZ4/view)

To compile the project:

```bash
